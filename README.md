This is a compendium made when studying to the exam in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. It is made for my own personal use, and is therefore very unpolised and probably full of small errors. However, it could hopefully be useful for future students of the course. Most of the notes are taken from this online book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ which is very well written and highly recommended.
